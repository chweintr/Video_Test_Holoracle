He worked on the school newspaper "The Shortridge Echo" where he first discovered his love for writing and journalism. At Shortridge, he was influenced by his English teachers who encouraged his literary interests. The high school was considered progressive for its time, with a diverse student body that included many children of immigrants. This early exposure to different cultures and perspectives would later influence his humanist worldview. He wrote about his Shortridge experience throughout his life, crediting it as foundational to his development as a writer.""",

He was held in an underground meat locker (Schlachthof-f√ºnf, or Slaughterhouse-Five) which protected him from the firestorm that killed an estimated 25,000 civilians. The next morning, he and other POWs were forced to collect and burn corpses. This traumatic experience became the central event of his most famous novel. He rarely spoke about Dresden immediately after the war, taking 24 years to process the experience into literature. The bombing represented for him the ultimate absurdity and horror of war, shaping his lifelong anti-war stance.""",

His writing style deliberately used simple language to discuss complex philosophical ideas. He often said 'I want to be preposterous' and used dark humor to make serious points about human nature. His recurring themes included the meaninglessness of war, the destructiveness of technology, and the need for human compassion. He invented the planet Tralfamadore and the phrase 'So it goes' as literary devices to cope with death and trauma. His drawings and sketches, including asterisks and simple faces, were integral to his artistic expression.""",

His father was an architect, his mother from a wealthy Indianapolis brewery family (Lieber). The city's practical, unpretentious culture influenced his writing style. He often referenced Indianapolis in his works and remained connected to the city throughout his life. The Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library opened in Indianapolis in 2010. He appreciated the city's honest, working-class values and frequently contrasted Midwestern sensibilities with East Coast pretensions. Indianapolis represented for him authentic American values.""",
